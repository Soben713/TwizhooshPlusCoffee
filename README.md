# Twizhoosh Plus Coffee :coffee:

The famous @twizhoosh bot is coming to your browser. The proposed plan for this project is as follows:

- OAuth 2.0 for users to authenticate using their twitter accounts.
- An online interpreter for commands
- A @twizhoosh tweets feed
- A feature request page
- A learning page where users write conversations and possible answers to them. After getting moderated, they will be added to @twizhoosh's wisdom.
- Scheduling tweets: An interface to write a message/congrats/notification to someone, and a time. @twizhoosh will mention you and that person with that message. In case of simple dates, we can also add this to the twitter account commands, too.
- Magic Ball: From all the ones that @twizhoosh follows, from time to time, he will give a magical power to someone, he will give that person a time and a private link. During that time @twizhoosh will echo everything that person says. Two remarks: We need to moderate this feature, and we should make sure we give no clues, that this magic ball has just activated, so the users may wonder what is going on. It's just like an anonymous session for someone to say what he/she is afraid of. It is a controversial feature.
- And more features are coming! Stay tuned.
